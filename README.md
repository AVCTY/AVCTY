# Hi there 👋

## 🤔 About Me
<p align="justify">😄 Hello! Nice to meet you. I'm Arthur, a CompSci graduate who majored in AI. Currently, I involve myself in mainly creating AI solutions and in my free time, the development of full stack web apps as well.</p>

<p align="justify">I am mainly a Python Developer and I enjoy making and developing things that I find useful, which is why most of the projects I have on here reflect my passion to create things that will be useful in helping others or improving current problems.</p>

<p align="justify">🕹️ During my free time, I would enjoy playing video games. Throughout the years, this has helped in improving my problem solving skills as a developer because I would view the problems as if it were a challenge in a game that needed solving. I also indulge myself in my other hobbies such as guitar, drawing, making custom keyboards.</p>

<p align="justify">🍩 I also enjoy cooking! Whenever I am stuck on a problem or stressed out, I would take a break and indulge myself in cooking videos or cook up whatever I was planning to make and eat for the day. It helps me clear my mind so that I can tackle my problems with a fresh cool head.</p>
